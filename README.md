# SCUDA: GPU-over-IP

SCUDA is a GPU over IP bridge allowing GPUs on remote machines to be attached
to CPU-only machines.

## Running the server

```sh
cargo run --features=disable-preload
```

## Running the client

If the server above is running:

```sh
chmod +x local.sh
./local.sh run
```

The above will rebuild the client and run nvidia-smi for you.

## Installation

To install SCUDA, run the server binary on the GPU host:

```sh
scuda -l 0.0.0.0:0
```

Then, on the client, run:

```sh
scuda <ip>:<port>
```

## Building from source

```sh
nvcc -shared -o libscuda.so client.c
```

This library can then be preloaded

```sh
LD_PRELOAD=libscuda.so nvidia-smi
```

By default, the client library passes calls through to the client. In other words,
it does not connect to a server. To connect to a server, create a file with the
host you wish to connect to

```
~/.config/scuda/host
```
